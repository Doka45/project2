          How long are you awake in the morning before you go online? Perhaps it’s while you’re still lying in bed, 
          using a news feed or social media as the needed stimulant to push you out from under the covers. Or maybe 
          you wait to open your device until after a warm shower and cup of coffee. If you use sleep tracking apps, 
          you might say you never signed off in the first place.</p>
          <p>
          And, like millions of others during the pandemic, the internet is probably what enabled you to stay in touch 
          with family, or complete entire years of work and/or school remotely. If this sounds familiar, then you live 
          in a part of the world where an internet connection now counts as an essential utility — one that’s as easy to 
          take for granted as the natural gas heating your shower water or the electricity powering your coffee maker.</p>
          <p>But if you think we’re hyperconnected today, just wait. Globally, just over 55% of today’s households have an 
            internet connection. This gap between the internet haves and have-nots is referred to as the digital divide, 
            and access is skewed toward richer nations. The gap is projected to close in the next decade as billions of 
            homes connect to the internet for the first time and by 2030 it’s estimated that the technology industry could 
            account for 20% of the global electricity demand. This presents a troublesome dichotomy. On one hand, it supports 
            livelihoods, educations, and bolsters the global economy; on the other hand, the increased usage of the apps, 
            websites, and services that we build will place an even greater strain on our already-overloaded power grids.</p>
